# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Travelling Salesman Problem (T.S.P) customized to work with the Smart Bin Dashboard application.

#Description 
The T.S.P algorithm is used to find the optimal path from the source to all the points/destinations back to the source(The final destination is the source itself) traversing each point only once. Examining the algorithm in more detail, the source and destination points are the same. For the smart bin dashboard application this algorithm has to be modified. The modified algorithm has a source point(the current location of the garbage truck) that is dynamic and a destination point(the garbage truck base) that is static.
